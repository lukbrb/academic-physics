    "- We will first build typical machine learning classifiers, such as the KNN, SVM, MLP etc... which take as input some processed numeric data\n",

    "The `NVOTE` feature of our dataset has a very different scale and contains some outliers. These two characteristics lead to difficulties to visualize the data and, more importantly, they can degrade the predictive performance of many machine learning algorithms. Unscaled data can also slow down or even prevent the convergence of many gradient-based estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed many estimators are designed with the assumption that each feature takes values close to zero or more importantly that all features vary on comparable scales. In particular, metric-based and gradient-based estimators often assume approximately standardized data (centered features with unit variances). A notable exception are decision tree-based estimators that are robust to arbitrary scaling of the data.\n",
    "(ref: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_all_scaling.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Scaler\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard scaler removes the mean and scales the data to unit variance. The scaling shrinks the range of the feature values. However, the outliers have an influence when computing the empirical mean and standard deviation. Standard scaler therefore cannot guarantee balanced feature scales in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Min Max Scaler\n",
    "Min-Max Scaler rescales the data set such that all feature values are in the range [0, 1]. However, this scaling compresses all inliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both standard scaler and min-max scaler are very sensitive to the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Max Abs Scaler\n",
    "\n",
    "Max Abs Scaler is similar to Min-Max Scaler except that the values are mapped across several ranges depending on whether negative OR positive values are present. If only positive values are present, the range is [0, 1]. If only negative values are present, the range is [-1, 0]. If both negative and positive values are present, the range is [-1, 1]. On positive only data, both MinMaxScaler and MaxAbsScaler behave similarly. MaxAbsScaler therefore also suffers from the presence of large outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robust Scaler\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the previous scalers, the centering and scaling statistics of RobustScaler are based on percentiles and are therefore not influenced by a small number of very large marginal outliers. Consequently, the resulting range of the transformed feature values is larger than for the previous scalers. Note that the outliers themselves are still present in the transformed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "Power Transformer applies a power transformation to each feature to make the data more Gaussian-like in order to stabilize variance and minimize skewness. Currently the Yeo-Johnson and Box-Cox transforms are supported and the optimal scaling factor is determined via maximum likelihood estimation in both methods. By default, PowerTransformer applies zero-mean, unit variance normalization. Note that Box-Cox can only be applied to strictly positive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantile Transformer \n",
    "\n",
    "QuantileTransformer applies a non-linear transformation such that the probability density function of each feature will be mapped to a uniform or Gaussian distribution. In this case, all the data, including outliers, will be mapped to a uniform distribution with the range [0, 1], making outliers indistinguishable from inliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "RobustScaler and QuantileTransformer are robust to outliers in the sense that adding or removing outliers in the training set will yield approximately the same transformation. But contrary to RobustScaler, QuantileTransformer will also automatically collapse any outlier by setting them to the a priori defined range boundaries (0 and 1). This can result in saturation artifacts for extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The Normalizer rescales the vector for each sample to have unit norm, independently of the distribution of the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that all of our samples except for `NVOTE` are probilities in the range [0, 1], setting all vectors to the same legnth seems to be the best way to normalize our data before training. The normalizer seems the best option in our case."
