## 1. [Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect](/GravitationAharonovBohmEffect)

The Aharonov-Bohm effect was predicted by Aharanov and Bohm [1]
in 1959, and shortly after confirmed by experimentation [3, 11, 12]. In
this paper, we study the gravitational analogue of this magnetic effect,
and determine to what extent the analogy can be pursued. We show that
given particular metrics, a phase shift can be identified.

## 2. [Supernnovæ Data Analysis](/supernovae-analysis)

Until the early 1990, a cosmological model of Friedmann type with either radiations or dust as main energetic components was thought to be the standard model in cosmology. It is however common in cosmology that when new data are available, we shall adjust some parameters or modify the model itself. The era of a model with a Λ-constant, or dark energy, finds its origin in 1994 with the measurement of the Hubble constant H0 by Freedman et al.(1994) [1]and Pierce et al.(1994) [5].
This, with the flateness imposed by the theory of inflation resulted in an age problem for the
universe, and required a Λ-term. However the idea of a non-zero Λ-term has always been around
and its apparition did not redefine the paradigm of the model. Only later when the analysis of
Supernovae of Type Ia (SNIa) from Perlmutter [4] et Riess [6] came, it has been realized that a
large enough Λ-term was needed to cause an acceleration of the expansion of the universe.
Nowadays, the ΛCDM has become the standard cosmological model. Λ for the cosmological con-
stant, and CDM for Cold Dark Matter. Although able to reproduce with high precision numerous
observations, this concordance model implies some dark components representing up to 95% of the
energy content of the universe and, from which we ignore properties.
Recently there have been some important discussions on the capability of SNIa data alone to prove
the acceleration of the expansion. In this work we try to determine if the available data permit to
conclude with certainty to a cosmic acceleration. In Sec. 2 we display the properties of SNIa and
introduce some notions of cosmology.

## 3. [Galaxy Classification](/galaxy-classification)

This project aims to give a tour of the Scikit-learn library capabilities, and to give some concrete examples on how to use classifiers for real world problems.
The problem we tackle here is the classification of galaxies. The data used comes from the Galaxy Zoo project. Convolutional neural networks are also studied.
